# DAO governance

The following is the DAO goverance model for Sena Labs.

> All sub-entities within Sena Labs have designated smart contracts to issue governance:
- Token distribution
- Organizational structure
- Technical Contribution by developers
- Distributed communication via Discord
- Partnerships

Sena Labs token holders are able to stake at least 5000 SENA tokens to vote on new partnerships, development suggestions, social media engagement, and NFT purchases the DAO intends to make. Internet-native SENA holders will be able to participate in bounties to find errors in  Sena's codebase. The bounty winners will have their DAO governance power increased based on successfully completing the bounty. Non-internet native token holders will be able to earn bounties by suggesting new features Sena should add to the official application. Internal DAO members will have the autonomy to vote on amendments pertaining to the organizational structure that external members. All members are validated through the colland feature via Discord.

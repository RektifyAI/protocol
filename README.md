# Sena Protocol
Sena is building a prolific DeFi advisory &amp; staking protocol. Click here to view our whitepaper.

This repository contains Sena's open source smart contracts, data analysis, data visulizations, and risk metrics. The value proposition for Sena is to be a DeFi advisory with limited liability in the case of exploits or hacks. The main sectors of DeFi that have been explored are the following:
- Lending
- Derivatives
- Funding
- Trading
- Insurance

----

Until now, advisory has been conducted by consultants that do not have the leverage to predict potential exploits in DeFi before its occurance. Sena is a better risk advisory by leveraging data science, analytics, machine learning, and edge computing to make prescriptive inferences on protocols' risk tolerance.

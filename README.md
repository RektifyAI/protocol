# Sena Protocol
A DeFi advisory &amp; staking protocol 

This repository contains Sena's open source smart contracts, data analysis, data visulizations, and risk metrics. The value proposition for Sena is to be a DeFi advisory with limited liability in the case of exploits or hacks. The main sectors of DeFi that have been explored are the following:
- Lending
- Derivatives
- Funding
- Trading
- Insurance

Until now, advisory has been conducted by consultants that do not have the leverage to predict potential exploits in DeFi before its occurance. Sena is a better risk advisory by leveraging data science, analytics, machine learning, and edge computing to make prescriptive inferences on protocols' risk tolerance.

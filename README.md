# Sena Protocol
Sena is building a prolific DeFi advisory protocol. Click here to view our whitepaper.

This repository contains Sena's open source smart contracts, data analysis, data visulizations, and risk metrics. The value proposition for Sena is to be a DeFi advisory with limited liability in the case of exploits or hacks. The main sectors of DeFi that have been explored are the following:
- Lending and Borrowing
- Derivatives
- Credit
- Stablecoins
- Exchanges(CEX and DEX)
- Funding
- Asset Management
- Payments
- Assets
- Wallets
- Oracles
- Trading
- Insurance
- Automated Risk Advisory`**`

</br>

`**`Automated risk advisory is now introduced by Sena Labs with Sena protocol.

Until now, risk advisory has been conducted by consultants that may not have the leverage to predict potential exploits in DeFi before its occurance in an automated way. Sena is a prolific risk advisor by leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and edge computing to make prescriptive inferences on protocols' risk tolerance. The need for risk advisory and investment strategy is prevalent as the DeFi industry is growing at an exponential rate. According to [Decrypt.co](https://decrypt.co/76963/uniswaps-growth-pushes-defi-3-million-total-users), there are over 3 million DeFi users utilizing DEXs such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, dYdX, 1inch, and more, to-date(2021). By 2025 we project that number will triple as more people are attracted to Bitcoin, NFTs, smart contracts, and of course, the decentralized finance industry.
